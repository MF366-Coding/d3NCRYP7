# d3NCRYP7 - Simple Encryption and Decryption System
Made in Python

Not the best encryption/decryption system but one that is already pretty good for most purposes. Specially, because it's free and open source.

## Still in development
Expect a full how-to-use guide as soon as I finish this script

UI coming soon!
