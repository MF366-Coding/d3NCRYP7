# d3NCRYP7 - Simple Encryption and Decryption System
Made in Python with ‚ù§ by MF366

![d3NCRYP7's Logo, by me, MF366](/assets/logo.png?raw=true "d3NCRYP7's Logo")

Not the best encryption/decryption system but one that is already pretty good for most purposes. Specially, because it's free and open source.

## Modes
Current modes and their names:

- **QWERTY Mode** (can be called using ``qwerty_mode``, ``qwerty`` and/or ``mode_qwerty``)

- **Starts from the letter F** (can be called using ``f_start``, ``f_starts``, ``start_f`` and/or ``starts_f``)

## ToDo
What I **need** to and **gonna** add:
- An option that **inverts** the text while encrypting/decrypting it

What I am still thinking about adding or not (a bit more in favor of 'not' but...):
- An extra script that **loads an actual GUI** for easier acess from the user
