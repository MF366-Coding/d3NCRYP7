# d3NCRYP7 - Simple Encryption and Decryption System
Made in Python with ❤ by MF366

Not the best encryption/decryption system but one that is already pretty good for most purposes. Specially, because it's free and open source.

## Modes
Current modes and their names:

- **QWERTY Mode** (can be called using ``qwerty_mode``, ``qwerty`` and/or ``mode_qwerty``)

- **Starts from the letter F** (can be called using ``f_start``, ``f_starts``, ``start_f`` and/or ``starts_f``)

## ToDo
What I **need** to and **gonna** add:
- An option that **inverts** the text while encrypting/decrypting it

What I am still thinking about adding or not (a bit more in favor of 'not' but...):
- An extra script that **loads an actual GUI** for easier acess from the user

### Tests
A ticked checkbox means that it worked.

The number is how many tries I needed.

> After the first release, the test folder will be zipped and this section will be moved to another Markdown file.

- [X] Test 1 - Swapping A and Z - (5)
- [X] Test 2 - Swapping A and Z with new interface - (1)
- [X] Test 3 - With a different filetype; qwerty mode - (2)
- [ ] Test 4 - All the letters of the alphabet; C file; New rulesets for upper and lowercase - (X)
- [X] Test 4.1 - All the letters in the alphabet; C file; New rulesets for upper and lowercase using a custom/default key - (1)
- [X] Test 4.2 - Simple UI test - (N/A)
- [X] Test 4.3 - Using another encryption/decryption mode; Simple UI test with different arguments - (N/A)
- [X] Test 5 - Testing some changes I made to `main.py` - (1)

Yep, **d3NCRYP7** only failed one test.
