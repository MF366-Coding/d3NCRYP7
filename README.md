# d3NCRYP7 - Simple Encryption and Decryption System
Made in Python with ❤ by MF366

Not the best encryption/decryption system but one that is already pretty good for most purposes. Specially, because it's free and open source.

## Modes
Current modes and their names:

- **QWERTY Mode** (can be called using ``qwerty_mode``, ``qwerty`` and/or ``mode_qwerty``)

- **Starts from the letter F** (can be called using ``f_start``, ``f_starts``, ``start_f`` and/or ``starts_f``)

## Still in development
What I am probably gonna add:
- **Custom modes** the user can create (respecting some rules, obviously)

What I am still thinking about adding or not (a bit more in favor of 'not' but...):
- An extra script that **loads an actual GUI** for easier acess from the user

### Tests
A ticked checkbox means that it worked.

The number is how many tries I needed.

> After the first release, the test folder will be zipped and this section will be moved to another MarkDown file.
